Program checks if there are possible schedules for students for a given
start term and finish term, given all constraints.
This works by mapping a term number to each course, given all constraints.
It assigns a negative term number if course is not taken (e.g. elective that is not needed)

ASSUMPTION: term numbers start with 1
